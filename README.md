The final project for the Front-End Nanodegree from Udacity. The project required using the Google Maps API within React along with another third-party API (Foursquare, in my case) to retrieve data about the selected locations.

I decided to have a bit of fun with my project, and use the French city that I studied abroad in for a year, rather than my current city. Pau has a castle! A castle!!! My current city does not.
