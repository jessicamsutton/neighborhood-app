The final project for the Front-End Nanodegree from Udacity. The project required using the Google Maps API within React along with another third-party API (Foursquare, in my case) to retrieve data for the selected locations.

I decided to have a bit of fun with my project, and use the French city that I studied abroad in for a year. It's also a much more interesting place than where I live now. My current city does not have a castle.

NOTE: Once the app is in production build, a service worker will be registered and installed.
